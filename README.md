# Union-closed-Sets-Conjecture-Holds-for-Height-No-More-than-3-and-Height-No-less-than-N-1
For each given union-closed family F(n, m) of n elements and m sets, we discuss the union-closed sets conjecture from height number of the UC family, which is a natural parameter from lattice theory. In this paper, we call it height number of F(n, m), recorded as H(F). we prove that for any given union-closed family F, union-closed sets conjecture holds if its height number H(F) no more than 3 or H(F) no less than n-1.         Since the height number H(F) is a positive integer which is bounded between 1 to n. As an attempted approach and framework, if we can prove union-closed sets conjecture holds for all possible value of H(F), then union-closed sets conjecture is true.
